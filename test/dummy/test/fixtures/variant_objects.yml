# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  name: "Test1"
  desc: "test1 description"
# column: value
#
two:
  name: "Test2"
  desc: "test2 description"
